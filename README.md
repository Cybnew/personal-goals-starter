Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Spend 60 Minutes/Day learning to program.
2. Update this daily to become more proficient in Git
3. Use Instagram more
4. Get better at filming videos
5. Plan house projects
